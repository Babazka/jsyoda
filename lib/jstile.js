/** PrivateFunction: Function.prototype.bind
 *  Bind a function to an instance.
 *
 *  This Function object extension method creates a bound method similar
 *  to those in Python.  This means that the 'this' object will point
 *  to the instance you want.  See
 *  <a href='http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2007-01-03/bound-functions-and-function-imports-in-javascript/'>Bound Functions and Function Imports in JavaScript</a>
 *  for a complete explanation.
 *
 *  This extension already exists in some browsers (namely, Firefox 3), but
 *  we provide it to support those that don't.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *    (Object) obj - The object that will become 'this' in the bound function.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *    The bound function.
